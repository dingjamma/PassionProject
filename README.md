# PassionProject
A passion project I am doing as a student of BCIT SSD program.

## Summary
This is a canvas shooting game, simple yet fun, I am still figuring out how to do this on a mobile platform via flutter.
Thus I will using web app for this shooting game for now.

## Control
Use arrow keys to move and space bar to shoot the "aliens"
You clear the level when you destroy all the aliens
You fail when the aliens hit you
